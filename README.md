# FSDI 110: Intermediate Python and Flask

## Creating a user CRUD

### For this assignment, you'll have to build a RESTful CRUD using Flask. Just like before, you'll be required to upload all your code to GitHub  and share your repository.

 

### Acceptance criteria:

-[x] It is possible to create users via a POST request.

-[x] It is possible to read (or view) users via a GET request.

-[x] It is possible to update users via a PUT request.

-[x] It is possible to delete users via a DELETE request.
