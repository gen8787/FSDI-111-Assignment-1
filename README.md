# FSDI 110: Intermediate Python and Flask

## Creating a user CRUD

### For this assignment, you'll have to build a RESTful CRUD using Flask. Just like before, you'll be required to upload all your code to GitHub  and share your repository.

 

### Acceptance criteria:

-[x] 1. It is possible to create users via a POST request.

-[x] 2. It is possible to read (or view) users via a GET request.

-[x] 3. It is possible to update users via a PUT request.

-[x] 4. It is possible to delete users via a DELETE request.

-[x] 5. All data entry operations must be validated to ensure an end user cannot purposely or accidentally submit invalid data.

-[x] 6. As a bonus: distinguish between reading a single user or scanning (reading) all users!
